## Recommended dev environment
+ node.js: v22.13
+ npm: v10.9
+ os: ubuntu 22.04
+ VSCode, with Jest Runner extension installed

## Development setup
+ Run `npm install`
+ Run `npm run test` for running test (you can debug individual tests with Jest Runner VSCode extension)

## Build
+ Run `npm run build`

## Notes
+ Especially kept it simple (as requested in the task document: "simplest solution you can think"), meaning no fancy data structures or optimizations for match lookups, no match "id" generation.
